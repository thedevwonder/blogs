## Why is Gamora?

:bulb: Some thoughts on why I started this online space in the first place.

:heavy_check_mark: I work professionally as a Software Engineer and I am continuously learning. I have many :open_mouth: moments, which I'd like to compile together. These moments are some good learnings and ideas that may help in making me a better engineer. This is my notes. :notebook:

:heavy_check_mark: I am a problem solver at heart. I find it thrilling to solve problems, especially HARD ones. I don't fear taking on a Leetcode hard, and I love the grit of continuously running possible solutions in my head. So, I might write a few things about a few problems here.

:heavy_check_mark: I like engineering. For me, it is not limited to just pure Computer Science. I'd like to gather good knowledge on any field that interests me and I am in constant pursuit of making myself a better engineer. :hammer_and_wrench:
